### Problem Statement

You have a row of 𝟐𝒏 disks of two colors, 𝒏 light and 𝒏 dark. They alternate: light, dark, light, 
dark, and so on. You want to get all the dark disks to the left hand side and all the light disks to 
the right hand end. The only moves you are allowed to make are those that interchange the 
positions of two neighboring disks. Design an algorithm for solving this puzzle and determine the 
number of moves it takes.

Input: a positive integer 𝑛 and a list of 2𝑛 disks of alternating colors light-dark, starting with light
Output: a list of 2𝑛 disks, the first 𝑛 disks are dark, the next 𝑛 disks are light, and an integer 𝑚
representing the number of swaps to move the light ones after the dark ones
